# ST6-CLAUDE.md - SEAL Team Six Operational Guidance

## ELITE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TRANSFORMATION PROTOCOL

This file provides tactical guidance to Claude Code when executing ST6 transformation operations on this codebase.

### MISSION OVERVIEW

Transform civilian codebases into elite, military-grade software systems operating at SEAL Team Six standards of excellence.

### OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES

#### ðŸŽ¯ SEAL Team Six Core Values Applied to Code

1. **The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday**
   - Every commit must improve upon the last
   - Continuous improvement is mandatory
   - Comfort zones are kill zones

2. **Ready to Lead, Ready to Follow, Never Quit**
   - Code with leadership mentality
   - Accept feedback with warrior humility
   - Persistence through all obstacles

3. **Earn Your Trident Every Day**
   - Excellence is not permanent
   - Prove your worth with every line
   - Standards never slip

### TACTICAL CODING STANDARDS

#### Naming Conventions
- **Repositories**: `ST6_[ProjectName]`
- **Files**: `ST6_[OriginalName].[ext]`
- **Functions**: Descriptive, action-oriented names
- **Variables**: Clear intent, no ambiguity

#### Code Structure
```python
# ST6_example.py
"""
Mission: [Clear objective statement]
Author: [Operator designation]
Classification: [Public/Internal/Classified]
"""

class TacticalOperation:
    """Elite implementation of [functionality]."""
    
    def execute_mission(self):
        """Execute with zero margin for error."""
        # Tactical implementation
        pass
```

#### Documentation Requirements
- **Mission Briefing**: Every file starts with purpose
- **Tactical Comments**: Explain the "why", not the "what"
- **After Action Reports**: Comprehensive commit messages

### DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS PROTOCOL

#### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Analyze existing codebase thoroughly
- Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities
- Map transformation strategy

#### Phase 2: Planning
- Create detailed TASKS.md with objectives
- Set measurable success metrics
- Establish tactical milestones

#### Phase 3: Execution
- Transform systematically, file by file
- Test with extreme prejudice
- Document all operations

#### Phase 4: Verification
- Validate against ST6 standards
- Performance benchmarking
- Security audit

### GIT OPERATIONS DOCTRINE

#### Commit Message Format
```
ST6: [Action] [Component] [Impact]

- [Detailed change 1]
- [Detailed change 2]
- [Performance/Security implications]

[Mission metrics if applicable]

```

#### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready, battle-tested code
- `dev-st6`: Active transformation work
- `feature/st6-[component]`: Specific operations

### MEMORY OPERATIONS PROTOCOL

#### Session Start
1. Check mem0 MCP status
2. Check Supabase MCP status
3. Load previous mission context
4. Verify knowledge persistence

#### Session End
1. Save all progress to memory systems
2. Create BRIEF_[timestamp].md
3. Commit all changes
4. Verify memory storage

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES SUPPORT

For operators transitioning from construction to software engineering:

#### Construction â†’ Code Parallels
- **Foundation Work** â†’ Architecture Design
- **Structural Integrity** â†’ Code Reliability
- **Safety Standards** â†’ Security Protocols
- **Project Management** â†’ Sprint Planning
- **Quality Control** â†’ Testing Suites
- **Documentation** â†’ Code Comments

#### Recommended Learning Path
1. **Basic Training**: Python fundamentals
2. **Advanced Training**: Design patterns
3. **Specialized Training**: Domain expertise
4. **Combat Ready**: Full-stack capability

### PERFORMANCE METRICS

Track all operations with:
- Lines of code transformed
- Test coverage percentage
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements
- Documentation completeness

### OPERATIONAL SECURITY

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Always validate inputs
- Sanitize all outputs
- Assume hostile environment
- Defense in depth

### CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

After each session:
1. Review what worked
2. Identify what didn't
3. Adjust tactics
4. Update procedures
5. Share lessons learned

### ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

When starting ST6 transformation:

```bash
# 1. Verify environment
git status
pwd

# 2. Check memory systems
# Start mem0 and Supabase MCP servers

# 3. Load mission context
cat TASKS.md
cat ST6_MISSION_BRIEFING.md

# 4. Begin operations
echo "ST6 TRANSFORMATION: WEAPONS HOT"
```

Remember: We don't rise to the level of our expectations; we fall to the level of our training. Train hard, code harder.

**"The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in battle."**
